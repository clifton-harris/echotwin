## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Voice Cloning Training
To fine-tune the [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) YourTTS model on
your own dataset, run:

```bash
python train_yourtts.py
```
The script installs missing Python packages and attempts to download the
dataset archive from Google Drive into `/content/gma_audio_files`. If the
download fails (for example, due to network restrictions), place the extracted
files manually in that folder. Once the dataset exists, the script cleans the
metadata, clones the TTS repository, creates a multilingual, multi-speaker
config, and launches training with checkpoints saved to `/content/yourtts_output`.
