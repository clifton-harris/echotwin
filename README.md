## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Voice Cloning Training
To fine-tune the [Coqui TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) YourTTS model on
your own dataset, run:

```bash
python train_yourtts.py
```
The script downloads the TTS repository, cleans the dataset in
`/content/gma_audio_files`, creates a configuration with multilingual and
multi-speaker support, installs missing Python dependencies, and launches
training with checkpoints saved to `/content/yourtts_output`.
